<b>Roll dice</b>
Place your token on the corner marked "GO", then throw the dices and move your token
(in the direction of the arrow) the number of spaces indicated by the dice. 
Depending on the space your token reaches,

Page 3:
 you may be entitled to buy real estate or other properties, or be obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, draw a Chance or Community Chest card, Go To Jail, or etc...
If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, and are subject to any privileges 

Page 4:
or penalties pertaining to the space on which you land.
Retaining the dice, throw again and move your token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession, move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail".

Page 5:
<b>Pass GO</b>
Each time a player's token lands on or passes over GO, whether by throwing the dice or drawing a card, that player gets a $200 salary.

Page 6:
<b>Buying Property</b>
Whenever you land on an unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership. Place the title deed card face up in front of you.

Page 7:
If you do not wish to buy the property, the Bank sells it at through an auction to the highest bidder. The high bidder pays the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property.
Any player,

Page 8:
 including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price.
 
Page 9:
<b>Paying Rent</b>
When you land on a property that is owned by another player, the owner collects rent from you in accordance with the list printed on its Title Deed card.
 If the property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. 
 
Page 10: 
It is an advantage to hold all the Title Deed cards in a color-group (i.e., Boardwalk and Park Place, or Connecticut, Vermont and Oriental Avenues) because the owner may then charge double rent for unimproved properties in that colour-group. 

Page 11:
This rule applies to unmortgaged properties even if another property in that colour-group is mortgaged.
 It is even more advantageous to have houses or hotels on properties because rents are much higher than for unimproved properties.
 
Page 12:
The owner may not collect the rent if they fail to ask for it before the second player following throws the dice.

Page 13:
<b>Jail</b>
You land in Jail when...
(1) Your token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail",
(2) You draw a card marked "Go to Jail" or
(3) You throw doubles three times in succession.

Page 14:
When you are sent to Jail you cannot collect your $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where your token is on the board, you must move directly into Jail. Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.

Page 15:
If you are not "sent to jail" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, you are
"Just Visiting", you incur no penalty, and you move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

Page 16:
You still are able to collect rent on your properties because you are "Just Visiting".

Page 17:
A player gets out of Jail by...
(1) Throwing doubles on any of your next three turns,
if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw.

Page 18:
Even though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn.
(2) Using the "Get Out of Jail Free Card"
(3) Purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free Card" from another player and playing it.

Page 19:
(4) Paying a fine of $50 before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns. If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw.

Page 20:
Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell property, buy and sell houses and hotels and collect rents.
